# Growable Neural Network

What will happen when a neural cell is tired in brain?

We think when human is absorbed in something, the partly of brain will be high workload. There is some merchanism to mitigate and optimize this work pressure.

We guess the tired neural cell will ASK the stem cell to increase its copy!

Still need more biology and computer-side experiment.
